# Maintenance Workflow

## Manager Overview

The maintenance workflow manages the complete lifecycle of aircraft maintenance issues, from initial problem discovery through resolution and return to service. This system ensures aircraft safety, tracks maintenance costs, and maintains regulatory compliance while minimizing aircraft downtime.

**Key Stages:**
1. **Issue Discovery** - Identification of maintenance problems during operations
2. **Problem Documentation** - Detailed reporting and priority assessment
3. **Work Assignment** - Routing to appropriate maintenance personnel
4. **Repair Execution** - Performing maintenance work and documentation
5. **Return to Service** - Validation and aircraft availability restoration
