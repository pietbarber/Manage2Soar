# System Overview - Manage2Soar Workflows

## Manager Overview

Manage2Soar is designed around the core activities of a soaring club: managing members, scheduling duties, logging flights, tracking instruction, and handling payments. The system integrates these activities so that information flows naturally from one process to another.

**Key Principles:**
- **Member-Centric**: Everything revolves around club members and their activities
- **Flight Operations Focus**: Daily flight operations drive most data collection
- **Integrated Workflows**: Each process connects to and supports the others
- **Role-Based Access**: Different members see different features based on their club roles

## Technical Implementation

### **Django Apps Structure**

| App | Purpose | Key Models | Dependencies |
|-----|---------|------------|--------------|
| `members` | User management, profiles, roles | Member, Badge | Auth (Django) |
| `logsheet` | Flight operations, glider fleet | Flight, Logsheet, Glider | members |
| `duty_roster` | Duty scheduling | DutyAssignment, DutyDay | members |
| `instructors` | Training management | TrainingLesson, SyllabusDocument | members |
| `knowledgetest` | Written examinations | TestSession, Question | members |
| `analytics` | Read-only reporting | *(no models)* | logsheet, members |
| `notifications` | Communication system | Notification | members |
| `cms` | Content management | Page, HomePageContent | members |
| `siteconfig` | System configuration | *(admin only)* | *(none)* |

### **Key Integration Points**

1. **Member Model**: Central user model extended from Django's AbstractUser
2. **Signals**: Cross-app communication for automated actions
3. **Permissions**: Role-based access control throughout the system
4. **Shared Templates**: Common UI components and styling

### **Database Relationships**

    Member ||--o{ Flight : pilots
    Member ||--o{ TrainingLesson : instructs
    Member ||--o{ TestSession : takes

    Logsheet ||--o{ Flight : contains
    Glider ||--o{ Flight : flown
    
    TrainingLesson ||--o{ Flight : validates
    SyllabusDocument ||--o{ TrainingLesson : guides
```
