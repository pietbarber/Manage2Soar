# Payment Workflow

## Manager Overview

The payment workflow manages the complete financial lifecycle of flight operations, from automatic cost calculation through payment collection and account reconciliation. This system integrates flight data with pricing rules to generate accurate member billing, supports various payment methods, and maintains comprehensive financial records.

**Key Stages:**
1. **Cost Calculation** - Automatic computation of flight costs based on operations data
2. **Member Billing** - Generation of individual member charges and notifications
3. **Payment Processing** - Collection and recording of payments from various sources
4. **Account Management** - Member account balances and payment history tracking
5. **Financial Reconciliation** - Period-end reconciliation and reporting
