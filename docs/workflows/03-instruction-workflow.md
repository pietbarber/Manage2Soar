# Instruction Workflow

## Manager Overview

The instruction workflow manages the complete training lifecycle for club members learning to fly gliders. This includes lesson planning, flight instruction, progress tracking, and certification management. The system integrates instruction records with flight logging to provide comprehensive training documentation.

**Key Stages:**
1. **Student Assessment** - Evaluate student readiness and goals
2. **Lesson Planning** - Create structured training curriculum
3. **Flight Instruction** - Conduct actual training flights
4. **Progress Tracking** - Monitor student advancement through syllabus
5. **Certification** - Document achievements and endorsements

## Key Integration Points

### **Flight Operations Integration**
Training lessons are tightly integrated with flight logging:

    B --> C[Duty Officer Logs Flight]
    C --> D[Flight Linked to Lesson]
    D --> E[Instructor Completes Lesson]
    E --> F[Progress Updated]
    F --> G[Reports Generated]

        I[Instructor â†’ Instructor]
        J[Lesson Date â†’ Flight Date]
        K[Training Type â†’ Flight Purpose]
    end
```

### **Notification Triggers**
The system sends automated notifications for:
- New student assignments to instructors
- Lesson scheduling confirmations
- Progress milestone achievements
- Phase completion approvals needed
- Check ride scheduling requirements

### **Analytics Integration**
Training data feeds into analytics for:
- Instructor performance metrics
- Student progress statistics
- Training phase completion rates
- Seasonal training activity patterns
