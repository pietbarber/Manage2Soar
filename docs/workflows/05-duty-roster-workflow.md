# Duty Roster Workflow

## Manager Overview

The duty roster workflow manages the scheduling and assignment of club members to essential operational roles. This includes duty officers, assistant duty officers, instructors, tow pilots, and other staff needed for safe daily flight operations. The system balances member availability, qualifications, and preferences while ensuring adequate coverage for all operations.

**Key Stages:**
1. **Roster Planning** - Determine coverage needs and generate schedules
2. **Member Availability** - Collect blackout dates and preferences  
3. **Assignment Generation** - Create duty assignments using automated logic
4. **Review and Approval** - Validate assignments and handle conflicts
5. **Ongoing Management** - Handle swaps, changes, and coverage issues

    B --> C[Pre-populated Duty Crew]
    C --> D[Operations Begin]
    D --> E[Flight Logging]
    E --> F[Duty Performance Tracking]
```

### **Member Qualification Tracking**
The system tracks and validates member qualifications:

```mermaid

    A[Member Profile Update] --> B[Qualification Change]
    B --> C[Update Duty Eligibility]
    C --> D[Regenerate Future Rosters]
    D --> E[Notify Rostering Team]

    B --> F[Historical Assignment Review]
    F --> G[Validate Past Assignments]
    G --> H[Update Records if Needed]
```

### **Communication and Notifications**
Automated notifications keep members informed:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Roster Published] --> B[Duty Assignment Notifications]
    B --> C[Calendar Invitations (.ics)]
    C --> D[Reminder Notifications]
    D --> E[Day-Before Reminders]
