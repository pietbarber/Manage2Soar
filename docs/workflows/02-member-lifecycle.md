# Member Lifecycle Workflow

## Manager Overview

The member lifecycle describes how individuals join the club, get their profiles set up, receive appropriate permissions, and progress through different membership levels. This is the foundation workflow that enables all other club activities.

**Key Stages:**
1. **Registration** - New user creates account via Google OAuth2
2. **Profile Setup** - Basic information and club-specific details
3. **Membership Activation** - Admin approval and status assignment
4. **Role Assignment** - Permissions based on qualifications and club roles
5. **Ongoing Management** - Updates, renewals, and status changes

## Process Flow

## Technical Implementation

### **Models Involved**
- **`members.Member`**: Extended Django User model with club-specific fields
- **`members.Badge`**: Soaring badges and certifications
- **`notifications.Notification`**: Welcome messages and status updates

### **Key Files**
- **Pipeline**: `members/pipeline.py` - OAuth2 user creation and setup
- **Views**: `members/views.py` - Profile management and display
- **Forms**: `members/forms.py` - Profile editing and validation
- **Admin**: `members/admin.py` - Membership approval and management

    Full_Member --> Family_Member: Family Plan
    Full_Member --> Service_Member: Military Status
    Full_Member --> Honorary_Member: Special Recognition
    Full_Member --> Emeritus_Member: Retirement
    
    Full_Member --> Inactive: Non-payment/Violation
    Student_Member --> Inactive: Non-payment/Violation
    Inactive --> Full_Member: Reinstatement
    
    note right of Full_Member
        Default active status
        Can fly, instruct, serve duty
    end note
    
    note right of Inactive
        No system access
        Cannot participate
    end note
```

### **Database Schema**

```mermaid
erDiagram    
    Member {
        int id PK
        string username UK
        string email UK
        string first_name
        string last_name
        string nickname
        string membership_status
        boolean is_active
        boolean webmaster
        boolean instructor
        boolean duty_officer
        boolean tow_pilot
        text bio
        image profile_picture
        date date_joined
        date last_login
    }
    
    Badge {
        int id PK
        string name
        string description
        image badge_image
        int sequence
    }
    
    MemberBadge {
        int id PK
        int member_id FK
        int badge_id FK
        date date_earned
        string certificate_number
    }
    
    Member ||--o{ MemberBadge : earns
    Badge ||--o{ MemberBadge : awarded
```

## Key Integration Points

### **Downstream Dependencies**
Once a member is active, they can participate in:
- **Duty Roster**: Assignment to duty officer, instructor, or tow pilot roles
- **Flight Operations**: Logging flights as pilot or passenger
- **Instruction**: Taking lessons or providing instruction
- **Knowledge Tests**: Taking written examinations
- **Notifications**: Receiving club communications

### **Permission-Based Access**
Member roles determine access to different parts of the system:

    Member[Active Member] --> A{Role Check}
    A -->|webmaster=True| B[Full Admin Access]
    A -->|instructor=True| C[Training Management]
    A -->|duty_officer=True| D[Logsheet Management]
    A -->|tow_pilot=True| E[Tow Operations]
    A -->|Default| F[Basic Member Access]
    
    B --> G[Site Configuration]
    B --> H[User Management]
    B --> I[All Data Access]
    
    C --> J[Lesson Planning]

    E --> Q[Tow Rate Management]
    
    F --> R[Profile Management]
    F --> S[Flight History]
    F --> T[Badge Progress]
```
