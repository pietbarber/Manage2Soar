# Ground Instruction Workflow

## Manager Overview

The ground instruction workflow manages classroom-based training and theoretical knowledge transfer that complements flight instruction. This includes ground school sessions, individual briefings, safety seminars, and knowledge assessments that are essential for pilot development and regulatory compliance.

**Key Stages:**
1. **Curriculum Planning** - Develop ground school syllabus and learning objectives
2. **Session Scheduling** - Plan and schedule ground instruction sessions
3. **Content Delivery** - Conduct ground school classes and individual briefings
4. **Progress Tracking** - Monitor student understanding and completion
5. **Knowledge Assessment** - Validate learning through tests and evaluations
