# Ground Instruction Workflow

## Manager Overview

The ground instruction workflow manages the logging and tracking of individual ground-based instructional sessions between instructors and students. This is a simple system for recording one-on-one briefings, theoretical discussions, and lesson-specific training that supports flight instruction and student development.

**Key Stages:**
1. **Session Logging** - Record individual ground instruction sessions
2. **Content Documentation** - Document topics covered and lesson progress
3. **Progress Tracking** - Track student advancement through training lessons
4. **Performance Scoring** - Score student performance on specific training lessons
