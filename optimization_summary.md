# Performance and Code Quality Improvements

## Changes Made

### Database Query Optimization
- **Model delete method**: Replaced `.exists()` + `.count()` pattern with single `.count()` call
- **Admin delete methods**: Same optimization applied to both `delete_model()` and `delete_queryset()`
- **Performance Impact**: Reduced database queries from 2 to 1 per deletion check

### Code Quality Improvements  
- **Import cleanup**: Removed redundant `ValidationError` imports in test files
- **Unused variable removal**: Eliminated unused `member` variable in test
- **Import organization**: Moved imports to appropriate scope levels

### Files Modified
1. `siteconfig/models.py` - Optimized `delete()` method database queries
2. `siteconfig/admin.py` - Optimized both admin deletion methods
3. `siteconfig/tests/test_siteconfig.py` - Cleaned up imports and unused variables
4. `members/tests/test_utils.py` - Added missing import and removed redundant one

## Testing
- All 21 tests still passing
- Real database functionality verified (75 Full Members protected)
- Performance improvements confirmed with shell testing

## Benefits
- **Performance**: 50% reduction in database queries during deletion protection checks
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner imports and elimination of unused code
- **Consistency**: Following Django best practices for query optimization
