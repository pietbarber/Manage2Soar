# GKE Cluster Provisioning Vault Secrets
#
# COPY THIS FILE AND ENCRYPT:
#   cd infrastructure/ansible
#   mkdir -p group_vars/gcp_cluster
#   cp group_vars/gcp_cluster.vault.yml.example group_vars/gcp_cluster/vault.yml
#   ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/gcp_cluster/vault.yml
#
# This file contains secrets for GKE cluster provisioning.
# It should be encrypted with ansible-vault before committing.
#
# IMPORTANT: For most use cases, you don't need secrets here!
# The playbook uses your gcloud CLI authentication by default.
# Only add service account credentials if you need unattended/CI provisioning.

# ============================================================
# GCP SERVICE ACCOUNT (Optional)
# ============================================================
# Only needed if you're NOT using gcloud CLI authentication.
# For CI/CD pipelines or automated provisioning, provide a service account.
#
# The service account needs these roles:
#   - roles/container.admin (create/manage GKE clusters)
#   - roles/compute.admin (create VPCs, subnets, firewall rules)
#   - roles/iam.serviceAccountUser (for node service account)
#   - roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin (enable APIs)

# Option 1: Path to service account JSON key file
# vault_gcp_service_account_file: "/path/to/service-account.json"

# Option 2: Service account JSON content (inline)
# Generate this from GCP Console > IAM > Service Accounts > Keys
# vault_gcp_service_account_contents: |
#   {
#     "type": "service_account",
#     "project_id": "your-project-id",
#     ... (paste your service account JSON here)
#   }

# ============================================================
# CLUSTER SECRETS (Optional)
# ============================================================
# These are rarely needed for cluster provisioning.
# Most secrets are for the application deployment (gcp_app vault).

# Master authorized network for your IP (if you want to restrict API access)
# vault_admin_ip_cidr: "203.0.113.50/32"
