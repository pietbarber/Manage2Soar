# GKE Cluster Provisioning Vault Secrets
#
# COPY THIS FILE AND ENCRYPT:
#   cd infrastructure/ansible
#   mkdir -p group_vars/gcp_cluster
#   cp group_vars/gcp_cluster.vault.yml.example group_vars/gcp_cluster/vault.yml
#   ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/gcp_cluster/vault.yml
#
# This file contains secrets for GKE cluster provisioning.
# It should be encrypted with ansible-vault before committing.
#
# IMPORTANT: For most use cases, you don't need secrets here!
# The playbook uses your gcloud CLI authentication by default.
# Only add service account credentials if you need unattended/CI provisioning.

# ============================================================
# GCP AUTHENTICATION
# ============================================================
# The provisioning playbook currently uses your local gcloud CLI
# authentication (`auth_kind: application`) and does NOT consume any
# service account credentials from this vault file.
#
# For CI/CD or unattended provisioning, ensure that:
#   - gcloud is installed in the environment, and
#   - gcloud is authenticated with an account that has sufficient
#     permissions to create and manage the GKE cluster and related
#     resources.
#
# The service account needs roles that follow the principle of least privilege.
# Example (development / small projects):
#   - roles/container.clusterAdmin        (create/manage GKE clusters)
#   - roles/compute.networkAdmin          (manage VPCs, subnets, routes)
#   - roles/compute.securityAdmin         (manage firewall rules)
#   - roles/compute.instanceAdmin.v1      (create/manage VM instances as needed)
#   - roles/iam.serviceAccountUser        (impersonate node service account)
#   - roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin (enable required APIs, if not handled elsewhere)
#
# WARNING: These example roles are broad and overly permissive for production use.
#          For production environments, create custom IAM roles that include only
#          the specific permissions your provisioning playbooks require, instead
#          of relying on broad *Admin roles.
#
# If support for service account JSON keys is added in the future,
# corresponding variables will be documented here.

# ============================================================
# These are rarely needed for cluster provisioning.
# Most secrets are for the application deployment (gcp_app vault).

# Master authorized network for your IP (if you want to restrict API access)
# vault_admin_ip_cidr: "203.0.113.50/32"
