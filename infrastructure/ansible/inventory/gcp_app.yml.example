# GCP App Deployment Inventory
#
# COPY THIS FILE AND CONFIGURE:
#   cp inventory/gcp_app.yml.example inventory/gcp_app.yml
#
# This inventory is used for deploying Django apps to GKE.
# Since GKE deployments run from localhost (using kubectl),
# no remote hosts are needed.
#
# Usage:
#   ansible-playbook -i inventory/gcp_app.yml \
#     --vault-password-file ~/.ansible_vault_pass \
#     playbooks/gcp-app-deploy.yml

    # - This value is also used as a GCS bucket name in deployment playbooks.
    # - Leaving it unset or as a placeholder will cause deployment failures
    #   or unexpected behavior.
    # NOTE: This example file intentionally leaves gcp_project blank to force
    #       explicit configuration. When you copy this to inventory/gcp_app.yml,
    #       you MUST set gcp_project to your real GCP project ID before running
    #       any playbooks. The playbook includes validation to reject empty values.
