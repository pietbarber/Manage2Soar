# Manage2Soar ‚Äì Duty Roster & Operations Management

 - Flight ratings, club qualifications, SSA badges earned
 - Member Biographies including inline images and rich text formatting.

 -- include takeoff time, landing time, release height, glider, pilot, instructor. 
 -- Any errors or missing data are announced to the duty officer. 
 - Closeout including finances, who paid, who is on account, etc. 
 - Closeout including Tow Plane information, safety issues, Operation Essay. 
 -- Log maintenance issues, indicate a glider is grounded. 
 - Email sent to the duty crew the night before the operations reminding them of 
 -- offline equipment
 -- duty crew participants
 -- upcoming maintenance deadlines (transponder, parachutes, etc).
 - Review of past flight operations by any club member.

 -- a rich HTML editor text field describing what is expected
 -- relevant sections of 14 CFR highlighted as required for solo or ratings 

## Instruction Reports Based on Student Flying
 - Instructors are given opportunity to log flight instruction 
 - Instructors can give members qualifications based on training 
 - Instructors report on recent flight instruction sessions with: 
 -- performance grading for all items in the training syllabus 
 -- opportunity for writing an essay to describe the lessons learned. 

## Duty Roster and Operations Calendar Management

 -- Members can mark themselves unavailable for any duty indefinitely. 
 - Operations Calendar is populated with random selection of capable members 
 -- based on their blackout preferences
 -- based on the operational need 
 -- does not schedule members more than a certain number of times per month. 

## Operations Calendar
 - Any member can summon members for an ad-hoc operations date 
 -- Email sent to club indicating ad-hoc operations on a certain date. 
 -- tow pilots can sign up to tow. 
 -- duty officers can sign up to be the operations officer. 
 -- if those two conditions are met, email is sent to members indicating operations are a go. 

## Charts and Analytics
 - Several varieties of charts and graphs can be displayed for your club's statistics
 -- Flights to date this year 
 -- Compare this year to previous years
 -- Show usage of each glider in the club
