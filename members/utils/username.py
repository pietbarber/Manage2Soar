Username generation utilities for Member accounts.

The canonical username format is ``firstname.lastname`` (lower-case, letters
only).  When a collision occurs an incrementing numeric suffix is appended:
``john.smith``, ``john.smith1``, ``john.smith2``, …

    Strips all non-alphabetic characters from both name parts, combines them
