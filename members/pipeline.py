# debug_pipeline_data() Pipeline Function

# Debug utility that prints out the 'details' dictionary received from the
# OAuth2 provider during the social-auth pipeline. This is useful during
# development to inspect what user data (e.g., name, email, picture) is
# being returned by the identity provider.

# Parameters:
# - strategy: the current pipeline strategy object
# - details: dictionary of user info (email, name, picture, etc.)
# - *args, **kwargs: standard pipeline context

# Note:
# Should be removed or disabled in production to avoid printing sensitive data.

# create_username
# Generates a clean, unique username during social-auth pipeline execution.
#
# Combines first name, last name (or nickname), strips invalid characters,
# and falls back to email prefix if names are missing.
#
# Overwrites details['username'] and returns it for downstream use.

# set_default_membership_status() Pipeline Function

# This function assigns a default membership_status of "Pending" to any newly
# created user via social-auth (e.g., Google login). This signals to the
# membership team that the user authenticated successfully and is awaiting
# review or manual approval.

# This prevents users from defaulting to full member access, and provides
# a clean, typo-free base profile for further editing.

#########################
# fetch_google_profile_picture() Pipeline Function

# Downloads and stores the user's Google profile photo the first time they log in
# using OAuth2. This eliminates the need for the user to manually upload a photo.

# Conditions:
# - Only runs if the user has no existing profile_photo
# - Only triggers for the 'google-oauth2' backend
# - Grabs the photo URL from the OAuth response payload
# - Saves the photo to media/profile_photos/<username>.jpg

# Parameters:
# - backend: the OAuth2 backend (should be 'google-oauth2')
# - user: the Django Member object created or logged in
# - response: the full OAuth2 JSON payload (contains 'picture' field)

# Notes:
# - If the image cannot be downloaded or saved, the function silently fails
#   and does not raise an exception (login still succeeds).
