The CMS app manages the website's pages, document attachments, and homepage content. Below is a concise reference to the current models, routes, and developer notes.

Key points
- Audience: staff may edit content via admin; members and guests may view public pages.
- Route: `/cms/` (CMS directory/index) and site root (`/`) is routed to CMS homepage content when available.

Models (current)

- Page
	- title, slug, parent (self FK for hierarchy), content (HTML), is_public, created_at, updated_at
	- related_name `children` for sub-pages
	- documents: reverse relation to `Document`

- Document
	- page (FK -> Page), file (FileField), title, uploaded_by (user FK), uploaded_at
	- helper properties: `is_pdf`, `extension`

- HomePageContent
	- slug, title, audience (public/member), content, updated_at
	- reverse relation `images` to `HomePageImage`

- HomePageImage
	- page (FK -> HomePageContent), image (ImageField), caption, order

- SiteFeedback (Issue #117)
	- user (FK -> Member), feedback_type (choices: bug_report, feature_request, general), subject, message (HTML), status (choices: open, in_progress, resolved, closed), referring_url, admin_response (HTML), responded_by (FK -> Member), created_at, updated_at, resolved_at
	- Enables site-wide feedback collection and admin management

URLs and views (current)

- `/cms/` ‚Äî CMS index (list of top-level `Page` entries)
- `/cms/<slug>/` ‚Äî Page detail (supports nested pages via additional path segments)
- `/cms/feedback/` ‚Äî Site feedback submission form (Issue #117)
- `/cms/feedback/success/` ‚Äî Feedback submission success page
- site root `/` ‚Äî the project routes to `cms.views.homepage` which will render `HomePageContent` (audience-specific) when present, otherwise falls back to the CMS index

Developer notes

- The CMS uses `tinymce`'s `HTMLField` for page and homepage content. Uploaded documents are stored under `cms/<page-slug>/...` or obfuscated when a page is not public (see `upload_document_to`).
- The `Page.get_absolute_url()` implements a simple two-level slug URL scheme; nested pages route via `cms.urls`.
- **Site Feedback System (Issue #117)**: Provides comprehensive feedback collection accessible via site footer. Features include form validation, referring URL capture, webmaster notifications, and full admin management with bulk actions.
- **Footer Integration**: Site footer content is managed via HomePageContent with slug 'footer', includes feedback link with referring URL parameter.
- Database relationships are documented above using Mermaid diagrams.

Templates

- `templates/cms/` holds the templates for index, page rendering, and admin-ish edit forms used by staff.
- `templates/cms/feedback_form.html` ‚Äî Site feedback submission form with Bootstrap styling
- `templates/cms/feedback_success.html` ‚Äî Feedback submission confirmation page
- `templates/footer.html` ‚Äî Site-wide footer template with CMS content integration

Admin & permissions

- All models are registered in the admin for staff editing. Public visibility for pages/documents is controlled with `is_public` on `Page` and the `audience` field on `HomePageContent`.
- **SiteFeedback Admin**: Full-featured admin interface with list display, filtering, search, bulk status actions, and automatic response tracking. Includes custom display methods for referring URLs and responder names.

Where to look

- Models: `cms/models.py`
- Views: `cms/views.py`
- Forms: `cms/forms.py` (includes SiteFeedbackForm)
- Admin: `cms/admin.py` (includes SiteFeedbackAdmin with custom features)
- Context Processors: `cms/context_processors.py` (footer content integration)
- Database schema is documented using Mermaid diagrams in this README
